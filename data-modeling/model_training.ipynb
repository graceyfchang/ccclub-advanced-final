This feature is split into 7 individual features dayofweek0, dayofweek1, ... , dayofweek6. The value of these features is 1 if the timeStamp corresponds to that day of the week, otherwise it is 0.\n",

Recursive feature elimination tests the model accuracy on increasingly smaller subsets of the features to identify the subset which produces the most accurate model. Cross validation is used to test each subset on multiple folds of the input data. The best model is that which achieves the lowest mean squared error averaged across the cross validation folds.\n",

With time series forecasting, it is important that test data comes from a later time period than the training data. This also applies to each fold in cross validation. Therefore a time series split is used to create three folds for cross validation as illustrated below. Each time series plot represents a separate training/test split, with the training set coloured in blue and the test set coloured in red. Note that, even in the first split, the training data covers at least a full year so that the model can learn the annual seasonality of the demand."
